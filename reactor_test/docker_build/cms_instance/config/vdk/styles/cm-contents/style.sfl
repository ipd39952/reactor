# style.sfl - Verity-Defined Standard Fields
#
# These fields are included in the internal documents table.
# They are filled in by various filters and gateways that Verity ships,
# and are the "standard fields" that Verity suggests should exist in all
# Verity collections. They are not required in your collection. Instead,
# they are merely highly recommended to promote the ability to use your
# collection with other products that use Verity's search technology.
# You can comment out the fields below to save space, or uncomment others
# to gain functionality.

  # The following are fields that are available to be populated by Verity
  # filters, but are commented out by default to save space as they are
  # currently not populated by many documents.
  # To enable them to be populated, remove the hash (#) character
  # before indexing your documents.
  #
  # The following fields are filled in by "zone -news"
  #varwidth:   References	_sv

  # The following fields are filled in by flt_pdf
  # To enable any of these fields, copy one of the lines to a new line
  # and replace the field name with a unique name of your choosing.
  # Add an alias line beneath your new field that refers to the PDF field.
  # For example, an enabled FTS_Producer field, using the name MyProducer,
  # would look like the following:
  #    #varwidth:  FTS_Producer    _sv
  #    varwidth:  MyProducer    _sv

  #
  # These lines are commented here to keep them from being interpreted.
  # Note the relationship, however, of the lines you need to add to the
  # original line that begins with the hash (#) character.
